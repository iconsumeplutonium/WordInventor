# Word Inventor

This program is designed to generate fake words/names.

![Program in action](https://i.ibb.co/LSPtP7L/githubgif2.gif)

   * First it picks a random letter.
   * Next, it looks at that letter's list of acceptable following letters. 
   * From that list, it picks a letter randomly. 
   * This repeats until it reaches the maximum word length. 
   
Though it can generate words up to 18 letters long, the program generates decent sounding words when the max word length is between 3 and 7 letters. Sometimes it will occasionally spit out words that don't seem to be pronouncable/have any vowels, and other times it will spit out real English words.
